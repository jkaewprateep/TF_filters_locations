# TF_filters_locations
Find location of object by using Tensorflow filters

üß∏üí¨ For tracking location on the screen as we see from many applications or games is very easy but many APIs are released with many features and we could implement them later but we need to understand the concept first. <br>
üëßüí¨ To achevement of our goals by intercepting the ball with acceleration from byside, we need to locate the ball in the current and tracking location for prediction of the target distance and actions to perform. ```actions = { "up": K_w, "none": K_h, "down": K_s }```

### Pre-process image for filters ###
üêëüí¨ The inputs can be from many target sizes of the player screen, one way is to compact information within scope and we can restore information with lossy/lossless method after testing the input to requirements. The lossy method is the method compress images with target information remaining when lossless is the method to remain most of the information. TF.resize is the lossy method, and an example of the lossless method is lossless encodings or vectors image.
```
image = tf.keras.utils.img_to_array( image, data_format="channels_last" )
image_resized = tf.image.resize( image, size=( 32, 32 ), method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR, 
      preserve_aspect_ratio=False, antialias=False, name="image_resize" )
```

### Remove tuck players - remain ball on the screen ###
üê¨ü•Äüí¨ We know that the tuck player is the cylindrical shape or rectangular shape we do Normalization and filter out the result is only a ball running on the screen.
```
layer_1 = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(mean=3., variance=2.)( image_resized )
layer_2 = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(mean=4., variance=6.)( layer_1 )
	
image = tf.expand_dims( image_resized, axis=0, name="expand dimension" )
layer_3 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')( image )
```

### Reduce dimensions of the image output / channels ###

```
final_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(1, (2, 1), activation='relu')( layer_3 )
final_layer = tf.squeeze( final_layer, axis=0, name="squeeze" )
image_in_process = final_layer
```

### Target ball location X and Y ###

```
final_layer = tf.math.argmax( image_in_process, axis=0, output_type=tf.dtypes.int32, name="max_x" )
final_layer = tf.math.argmax( final_layer, axis=0, output_type=tf.dtypes.int32, name="max_x" )

final_layer_2 = tf.math.argmax( image_in_process, axis=1, output_type=tf.dtypes.int32, name="max_y" )
final_layer_2 = tf.math.argmax( final_layer_2, axis=0, output_type=tf.dtypes.int32, name="max_y" )
```
